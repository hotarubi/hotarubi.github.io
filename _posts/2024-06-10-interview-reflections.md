Since made redundant by Block/ CashApp in Feb, I have been through quite a few rounds of interviews and found myself struggle a bit interviewing with big techs, in the end I think I handled ok but think I really need to make a good reflection through my job hunting and interview experience so that I'll be able to interview better.

The first thing I really need to add to me regular review list is that I should keep myself prepared for big tech interviews on regular basis. I'm a good engineer and keep myself learning from work, but that does not necessarily make me a good interviewee so every a year or so I should consider warm myself up and try to apply for a couple of roles in big techs just for practice's sake, if not for switching job.

Next, I struggled a bit recalling the details about both what I have delivered, and what projects and initiatives I led, the lesson I learnt and the reflection I made. I tried to keep my simple log for my work and my study but those are not enough, as only one made enough reflection, internalize them, and under suitable occasions, apply the lessons to the real world problem solving then that's when you really learn from your past experience. Logging, reflecting, thinking deeper and applying, keep repeating until what you learnt became natural and part of you, then the past experience and behavioral interviews should be a cake.

Besides, I feel I didn't keep myself up enough with the job market trend. This is not just limited to the technical trend, but the talent market's demand, e.g. startup vs big tech, local employers vs global employers, and different sectors and industries. Not only I have not red enough about these, but I have constraint myself to a too small circle that I have not reached out to the broader communities and connect to other peers. I should consider more networking and join more communities and expose myself so I could gather the most up to date trend.

Last but not the least, I really need to keep remind myself that being able to break into the big tech and taking a role is a privilege that not every good engineer has the chance. Surely not everyone likes or fits well into big tech, but I still think the good compensation, especially by Australian standards, and the chances of solving the complicated technical and organizational problems, and knowing a big bunch of very talented people, all worth the drawbacks. However, the chances of working for a big tech, or a very fast growing start ups are more scarce in Australia than that in the US or in China, due to the smaller market but most importantly the worse financed industry. All in all, I need to stay humble and keep reminding myself do not take the privilege for granted and do not lose faith whenever I lost the chance somehow.
